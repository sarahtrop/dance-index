== README

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

    $ bundle install

Next, migrate the database:

    $ bundle exec rake db:migrate

Next, seed the database with sample data:

    $ bundle exec rake db:seed

If you need to reset the database (for some reason), run:
    
    $ bundle exec rake db:reset

This will reset the entire database, deleting what was there, restarting IDs and reseeding it with the data from seeds.rb.
